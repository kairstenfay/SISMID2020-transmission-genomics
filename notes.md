#### New Data - A Big Opportunity

Infections evolve over time (e.g. TB and antibiotic resistance).

Sequencing revolution ~2007.
NextGen sequencing tools developed and cost of sequencing plummeted.

Acquired resistance vs. primary resistance (side bar).
"[A] Index case for two-person outbreak" (A infects B)

#### It's hard to control outbreaks.
We don't see exactly when infection events happen.
We don't know who's infecting who and when.
We can use data to understand & control transmission -- core task of transmission epidemiology.

#### Sequencing less expensive now than ever.
Can now sequence thousands or tens of thousands of virus or bacteria samples in a single study.
Unprecedented, high resolution view of how organisms changing over time & space, from person to person in outbreaks.
Understand transmission in a better way by using standard techniques.

#### Bugs acquire small genetic variation as they spread.

Downsample to be as globally representative as possible.
Shows phylogenetic structure.
Clade designation derived from phylogenetic structure.
As time goes on, clades grow & diversify because viruses pick up small amounts of genetic variation.

#### Bugs even vary from person to person.
e.g. the game of "telephone"; acttga -> actcga -> actcga -> actcgc -> actcac

#### Can we use sequences to understand transmission?
Can we learn about who infected whom and when from sequence data?

Why do we want to know who infected whom?
* we don't really need to know at the level of specific individual infections
* we do want to know when, where and how transmission takes place
* drilling into the details of transmission can help us understand this
* and it can help to know when infection _did not_ occur

#### Data on genetic variation can help
* help with who infected whom - improve outbreak control
* bigger scale: help w/ choosing best vaccines, best antibiotics
